# About the project
There are many ways to research regarding on product market analysis, I try to do litle market analysis on t-shirt product just to know what is product are most sold, how the price, is there any intresting variable correlation in market place. With this analysis i believe it can be source of consideration in starting a clothing brand or launching t-shrit product.

But why t-shirt? here's why :
- Everyone is like at leats having t-shirt on daily basis right? it means t-shirt have broad market.
- T-shrit is cheap clothing item, everyone can buy it anyway.
- From business perspective t-shirt easy to produce

So i think this project is worth of time to do before starting your t-shirt business :wink:.
